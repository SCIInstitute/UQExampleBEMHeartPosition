# UQExampleBEMHeartPosition

This is an uncertainty quantification (UQ) example computing the effect of heart position on boundary element method (BEM) ECG forward computations.  This example is similar to the work of [Swenson, etal.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3362042/) but is implemented in [UncertainSCI](https://github.com/SCIInstitute/UncertainSCI) and [SCIRun](https://github.com/SCIInstitute/SCIRun).  

To run this example, use the
